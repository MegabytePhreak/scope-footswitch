This repo uses several submodules, make sure they are up to date.
After checking out the kicad-library repo, make sure to cd to it and run make to generate the actual KiCAD libraries.

SW Build Process:
1. Make sure the arm-none-eabi toolchain is on your path: `which arm-none-eabi-gcc`
2. Pre-build the libopencm3 library: `cd sw/ext/libopencm3 && make -j && cd ../../..`
3. Build the bootloader: `cd sw/bootloader && make -j && cd ../..`
4. Build the main application: `cd sw/scope-footswitch && make -j && cd ../..`

SW Programming process:
1. Connect SWD debugger (e.g. blackmagicprobe) to hardware
2. Connect micro-usb from pc to hardware
3. `cd sw/bootloader`
4. `./flash.sh`
5. Power cycle hardware, holding down the front panel button to force entry to the bootloader
6. `cd ../scope-footswitch`
7. `./dfu.sh`
